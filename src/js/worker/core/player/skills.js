/**
 * Assign "skills" based on ratings.
 *
 * "Skills" are discrete categories, like someone is a 3 point shooter or they aren't. These are displayed next to the player's name generally, and are also used in game simulation. The possible skills are:
 *
 * * Three Point Shooter (3)
 * * Athlete (A)
 * * Ball Handler (B)
 * * Interior Defender (Di)
 * * Perimeter Defender (Dp)
 * * Post Scorer (Po)
 * * Passer (Ps)
 * * Rebounder (R)
 *
 * There should be about 30 (number of teams) players with each skill, except 3 point shooting which should have 60.
 *
 * Keep cutoffs in sync with GameSim.js!
