                        bullshit here. Why? Because if a game charges you money
                        for power-ups, the developer makes more money if they
                        make their game frustratingly annoying to play without
                        power-ups. Because of this,{" "}

                        If you want to support Basketball GM continuing to be a
                        non-sucky game, sign up for Basketball GM Gold! It's
                        only <b>$5/month</b>. What do you get? More like, what
                        don't you get? You get no new features, no new
                        improvements, no new anything. Just <b>no more ads</b>.
                        That's it. Why? For basically the same reason I won't
                        make Basketball GM freemium. I don't want the free
                        version to become a crippled advertisement for the pay
                        version. If you agree that the world is a better place
                        when anyone anywhere can play Basketball GM, sign up for
