handle case where difficulty is so high factors switch to negative

in multi team mode, is there any issue with players refusing to sign with the title winner?
- https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/c9mcl2

make screen with 100% minus ad

re-evaluate contracts
- somehow market based
- update after ratings change in preseason

get rid of owner messages, replace with owner status page showing mood directly (bar chart)

make AI smarter about contracts
- then do cool shit, like a tunable "randomness" factor or something that lets you tune player development, and also overall talent level, and also distribution of different ratings (to sim different eras)

ui/api/setGameAttributes logic should be in worker, not ui. minimize transfer

center UI when possible
- when?
  - if banner ads are hidden (hideAds in initAds)
  - if ad blocker is in use (divs missing or something)
  - if not wide enough for skyscraper
- problem: NavBar doesn't like when a class is added alongside .container to do this. Revisit later, maybe.

too easy to trade for current season picks
- i think it's uncertainty+fudge factor decreasing too much when the outcome is certain

somewhere, show average age of team

increase PG cutoff
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8lfyuh/7_center_turns_into_pg_when_the_season_starts/

option to edit AI trade rate https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8kqzl9/trade_frequency/

"lineage" page to view all of a player's relatives

index updating
- currenty: check if the indexed property has changed, and only update a specific index then
- would be better: make _dirtyIndexes per index, not per store  
- even better: incrementally update index

customize playoff series length
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8b23uh/request_customizable_playoff_series_length/dx3bxd3/?context=3

Trade.js shouldn't have realtimeupdate, should be listening to a specific updateevent (like "trade") and that should be emitted in all the worker api functions
- same with the rest of UI, otherwise updates will only happen in one tab

later
- in new league: set rookie contracts appropriately
- in new league: initialize rebuilding/contending to non-random values
- don't include core.debug in prod builds?
- steeper penalties for unbalanced lineups
  - increasing perimfactor not enough - need to reevaluate formula. see all_bigs.json
    - perimfactor shouldn't be needed. just use the synergy stuff. should be offense and defense. check values for normal and extreme teams
- simulate draft from past seasons, to correctly assign contracts (don't need to populate actual draft info)

NEED TO FIX TRADE AI
- make tests of trades that should/shouldn't happen

no POT mode, to make it harder

p.valueWithContract is exactly equal to p.value currently!

team shot locations playoffs
- share code with team stats for highlighting and playoff W/L

persist fantasy draft results
- make an array of draft results
- viewable somehow - need to track when fantasy drafts happened and add them to draft results menu

career totals on player pages https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7ya1yu/any_more_thoughts_on_the_beta/duptp08/?context=3

when playing many seasons in one session, it slows down. why? ctrl+r restores   performance

open multiple leagues from dashboard at the same time - Invalid cache status "filling"
- looks like flush is being called while status is "filling", can that be short circuited since idb.cache has been redefined? lid is different, or the hostID is different?
  - happens because it calls "flush" when closing an existing open database. should be more explicit about state of loading (no league loaded or loading, league X loaded and no league loading, league X loaded and league Y loading, no league loaded and league Y loading)
  - then will also need a way to prevent UI errors, if a UI update function is running and expects e.g. g to be populated but it's not - UI should check the aforementioned state as well and wait for loaded

reevaluate FA system - too easy to rebuild
- too many young stars available
- first pick at most players

<b> in game sim results

move react up, before worker is initialized, so compareVersions error can be displayed there

somehow display synergy, maybe on roster page

watch list players should result in notifications when things happen (FA salary drops, trades, signings, release, retire)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7h3eqy/simple_feature_request/

sync achievements from IDB to account
- should be happening in account.check, but is it?

advanced team stats
- strength of schedule: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9e6d.html?p=37&cpage=1
  - to set up this system of equations, need to know the schedule, but that is not stored anywhere currently. need to persist original schedule. maybe only soft delete games as they are played, or copy to another table?
  - use https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-solve to solve
- team ortg/drtg/nrtg adjusted for strength of schedule

box plus/minus
- https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html
  - already have everything from "Raw BPM" formula (ReMPG is MP/(G+4))
  - for "BPM_Team_Adjustment", need team net rating (off rating - def rating). The sum term needs all players who played on a team this season, even if they are no longer on the team (annoying to implement, but doable)
    - net rating needs to be adjusted for SOS!
- VORP

advanced stat table too confusing? needs vertical dividers/spacing?

use something besides PER in player value formula

new adv stats in roster page?
- switch PER to WS/48 - roster.js now pulling both, then eventually switch Roster.js
- same for HoF
- OR, wait for BPM?

customizable columns in datatable
- get rid of supercols where possible, like bbr
- for supercols, instead of colspan, pass a list of column names (need to get rid of repeats like raw % first)
  - won't work when there are duplicates. instead needs to be a hierarchy. maybe just pass hierarchy with names, and do getCols in DataTable? but then how to pass extra props like width, is that really needed?
    - search through, find any weird ones, try to eliminate:
      - Draft - setting width, and splicing for fantasy draft
      - PowerRankings - setting width
      - TeamFinances - dynamically use years
      - TeamRecords - some overrides
      - Trade, TradingBlock - override for "" column
  - crazy idea: pass cols only as keys in data (change array -> object), and for supercols prefix like SuperCol|Col
  - or in cols array, add prop to denote supercols
- pass additional parameter containing which columns are visible, by name (if none, then assume all)
- get rid of search
- sortBy by name, not index
- button to reset datatable
- store all datatable params in one localstorage object
- always return all stats and ratings?

all caps columns, like b-r
- PPG -> Pts, probably

per 100 possessions and totals toggle on team stats page

remove babel plugins

remove polyfilles
- get rid of getAll polyfill when safari 10.x usage goes to 0
- others too!

some way to see draft picks by team, now that there are AI trades

AI trades
- notification? only for big trades. quantify! maybe show that info in transactions page too

AI propose trade to user
- need way to show popup with link to trade page

colors
- color ratings on ratings page (and tables), just like ratings popup
- color stats in ratings popover

filtering
- disable in some columns, like "Negotiate" buttons. maybe config in getCols?

force single tab per league
- when < 5 seconds, wait for another heartbeat before deciding
- check for collission in setInterval, and somehow show error page if that happens

shared worker
- namespace stuff, after it's working for one league
  - attach lid to promiseWorker instance in host (call it "metadata"), update lid if it changes, and attach to every request from host
    - then from worker, pass into toUI
  - query API: flag to determine if broadcast or single response. default single response. optional last arg, so single response use case is same API as now
    - if broadcast, then response is always undefined
    - broadcast needs to be namespaced, too. like only "update all league 5" not "update all tabs open in every league"
      - figure out some way to abstract... like maybe a conditional broadcast function defined based on metadata
  - namespace leagues (or force only one league)
    - namespace locks, g (in worker only), idb.league, and idb.cache
    - all common functions, accept g as param
    - something to handle init/close of tabs
    - look at all toUI calls
  - disconnect league when none are left registered to promise worker (so need api to get all metadata)

when dirty on close, show warning window, and initiate flush (if not already in progress)
- hard to coordinate across UI and worker...

better loading screen, after React takes control but before initial page is rendered - because it can be slow for loading a league

uncomment things using localstorage in worker, after moving to either env+api or idb (meta)
- top16playoffs - used in both, would be better in gameAttributes as a God Mode option

delete meta database after league tests (and others that create it)

this shit is UGLY UGLY UGLY, fix ASAP!!!
    if (typeof it === 'function') { return; }
  http://railsware.com/blog/2017/01/10/mocking-es6-module-import-without-dependency-injection/

unify build and watch scripts - use watchify programmatically

rethink cache API, with goal of having it typed
- rename indexes, store prefixed with storename
- get rid of new any types in types.js

error page (like invalid pid) should show league UI if in league

should checks to update data in worker/views be in worker, or could they be in UI somehow and avoid call to worker if update not needed?

if i can gracefully handle absence of g.season etc, put cache creation inside connectLeague
- not graceful now, see fill(season)

get tests working
- db.getCopy.teams
  - operate on individual functions? can export them just for tests
  - confirm operations that don't require IDB
  - confirm getAll updates from cache

player.sign, like player.addToFreeAgents to encapsulate tid changes

how do caches based on g.season work in preseason?

refactor
- clear, delete need to handle indexes

document cache data format and API!
- different things are cached, depending on object store
- all modifications go into cache
- cache mutations are dangerous, see getCopy
- read from just the cache if you're sure everything is there (like an active player). otherwise, read from db and augment with cache (because anything could be in cache, even if it's not normally.. like retired player added to watch list). getCopy variables do this
- promise microtask worker crap - for firefox support, if you start a backboard tx manually, you can't do any promise/asyncawait stuff inside the callback

can ui/util/logEvent be replaced by just notify? since it never writes to db?

event log refactor
- react
- keep state just on worker
- "event log" page with ALL events, should be impossible to "miss" an event

  React components: proptype validation only works for class-based ones. for functions, need proptypes and flow. even for class-based components, flow can give more flexibility, but does not do runtime checking. https://github.com/gcanti/babel-plugin-tcomb could help with that, but seems to create too many false positives. until there is a better solution, it's not urgent to port React components to flow.

    tricky: good teams have high skill players, who are going to do really well in any synergy metric. so it's hard to punish unbalanced teams through synergy without decreasing parity by a lot
      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT REVAMP
-------------------------

shouldn't have literally every aging player turn into a great shooter

old players are currently undervalued

player development revamp http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2cz7r6/player_development_code_has_kinda_ridiculous/
  too random, like players with pot=ovr are too likely to improve, makes low ovr high pot players less appealing http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/36402p/how_does_potential_for_players_work_in_basketball/cravpqu?context=3
  something needs to be done. still too many 3 point shooting centers
  are ovr/pot combos reasonable, since ovr is weighted now?
  old stars should exist
  reports that there are too many PGs with high pot - probably because they can't improve hgt, and hgt is highly weighted in ovr
  too many rookies come in as instant stars. should be more gradual.
  career arcs for ratings - like low endurance/athleticism for old players, but skills remain
  smaller improvement per year, but more consistent
  if ovr==pot for young player, debug.averageCareerArc(50, 50) should be flat but it's a bit bumpy
options:
  compute "pot" for each rating, use that to generate displayed pot
  somehow do it organically, with different rates of growth in different categories
current beta issues:
  different types of players should develop differently
    maybe make it multiplicative? should be much more likely to go from 50-100 than 0-100
    or cutoff-based, like if you're below 20 you're never going to improve there?
    or position-based? height-based?
    ideal: skill-based, train them as a real coach would
  newly-generated players don't have right skill labels
  tune with debug.averageCareerArc(30, 80)

IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
PER scaling in player.value is wrong http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1y2lci/some_thoughts/cfgz8yk
  change scaling in ovr formula? too confusing?
  this impacts rookie values, leating to an EXPLOIT: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1y2lci/some_thoughts/cfhkvnv
ovr changes should impact player.value, somehow
  probably by scaling PER from the previous season
    but what about old players? is this already factored in to the age decline in player.value?
    but are past years ratings always available from player.value? or is it sometimes done with fake player objects? need to check
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ydtpd/seems_much_more_random_now/cfjxhj6

  similarly, trading block for nothing can net you second round picks
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

  add some fucking market shit. calculate the salary demanded by free agents vs cap space available, then adjust free agent demands somehow

notification system
  customize: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1re3ea/new_feature_notification_bubbles/cdmjdyn
  "healed" should show after game, not before
  when fading out, hover should stop animation, remove notification-delete, reset timer to 1s (or something)
    hover on fading in should also stop animation so there is no stutter
  what about for small screens? maybe just show one at a time. is this actually a problem?
  also log these events:

    new team
  notify
    when something happens to a player on the watch list
    big AI moves - trades, free agent signings
  merge "retired" and "HOF" notifications for a player on the user's team

player stat summaries http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bf4z0/functionality_of_the_game_vs_2k/cj5ir16
unlimited draft class support
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2ajw7c/about_custom_draft/civz0n6
  take this opportunity to add some stuff to gameAttributes too
trading block should allow for multiple (different) offers from the same team
display of relative ratings like https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/144a4a04330edf3d
trade improvements
  refactor trade module with all the below in mind
    clean up even more?
      should create and updatePlayers be merged? updatePlayers already updates tids too
      either way, they should take partial objects and fill in the default/existing values
  trade suggestions (and trading block) should know salary rules
    HOW?
    team.valueChange could be made fast if I allow an extra argument to pass pre-fetched values from the database
    quick fix: check box to only look for teams under the cap http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qh107/proposed_trades_question/
  trades between AI teams
    call team.checkRosterSizes after this if it's in between days
team switching after being fired
  keep track of what team the user controlled, so stats for the user (not the team) can be shown
random events
  like.. player gets suspended, out X games. or player gets into fight, fan support drops. etc.
more detailed draft - slower picks, trades, etc.
  slower picks http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r70dv/trade_picks_during_draft
  sort by generic value (current) or team-specific value
  trade picks - note that the code in teamValue will need to be modified to account for the lottery and available players in the draft class
power rankings
  preseason too
  awards watch
contests: post roster file and goal

BIG NEW GAMEPLAY CHANGES
------------------------

Extended free agency
  order of AI team signings shouldn't be linear
  0 year contracts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1p0sa8/new_feature_extended_free_agency/ccy4gvp
  AI teams can release players to sign a better free agent?
fix contracts, signing
  goal: reasonable total payrolls, no good free agents left every season
  if WS distribution matches NBA, then look at $ vs WS. even better, build a multivariate model with age
  contracts should take ratings into more account, since stats on a good team are inflated and stats on a bad team are depressed
  player contract amounts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kj0p0/can_i_turn_off_firing/cbpxjyj?context=3
gameSim
  mediocre three point shooters should shoot it less http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bwvpj/psa_players_who_shouldnt_shoot_3s_continue_to/
  smart substitutions http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9w78/went_7012_with_this_roster_is_this_really_that/cj3zgui
  big men should score more, shoot more FTs http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2amqpo/how_come_all_of_the_top_scorers_are_always_3_guys/
  pos/neg effects add on like civ4 defensive bonuses?

  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbfzr43?context=3 http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k1881/pf_stands_for_powerful/
    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)
add free agent to the end of roster
fuzz should affect potential more than other variables, when pot is different than ovr
mode with ratings hidden
  implement like fuzz?
  maybe use very rough letter grades like A/B/C/D/F to replace the ratings
"My Player" mode http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2swmwj/there_should_be_a_game_like_myplayer_in_2k/cntkvj4

assist leaders too low
Number of years in college should depend on talent level
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
Make good young players much less likely to become FAs
Make rookie contracts 1 year longer
top menu tooltips for md
show team records in playoffs, conference standings
don't need to store abbrev with awards, just tids
  fix display in season summary (correct in historyAll)
show team records in playoffs page
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
Add markers for clinching playoffs / 1st seed in league standings
trading block crashing bug
  happens in chrome in old leagues, apparently. running out of memory somehow?
first errorNotify in contractNegotiation.js really should be inline within that page
league leaders glitch http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r20x5/league_leaders_bug/
merge game.play and freeAgents.play
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
current season shouldn't show in league history page dropdown

document things that affect player mood
in playoffs, replace "play week" with "play until end of round"
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked
in playoffs, replace Week/Month in Play menu with Round http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1w55sb/suggestionplayoffs_simulate_by_round_instead_of/
gamesim shot distribution - less people shooting 3s really poorly, especially tall players
UI to easily switch between conference and division standings on small screens and dashboard http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2d4o9r/feature_requests_of_the_week_august_10_2014/cjqrwtf?context=3
schedule page (and dashboard and maybe gamelog) should show opponent records
add "play until end of quarter" in live gamesim

LOW PRIORITY
------------

awards races throughout the season
attendance should change faster http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/30i8ts/should_attendance_be_more_responsive_to_extremely/
track longest W/L streaks
option to stop sim when player is injured http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2s265y/suggestion_option_to_automatically_stop/

use compound index on season + team for games obectStore in helpers.gameLogList, views.leagueDashboard, maybe elsewhere
upcoming free agents page should show at least some information about signings (or non-signings) during re-sign phase
tanking is too easy http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20038f/too_easy_to_tank/
contractNegotiation
  young players should only want short deals if they have really high pot-ovr
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"
ratings change during the season, especially young playerUI to easily switch between conference and division standings on small screens and dashboard http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2d4o9r/feature_requests_of_the_week_august_10_2014/cjqrwtf?context=3
compare players http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1saclf/suggestion_compare_players/
awards
  show awards count in hall of fame
add numbers for players
  ability to retire numbers
some players should make bad plays - not everyone should have same basketball IQ in gameSim
  add a rating for basketball IQ?
fantasy draft
  when fantasy draft is over, go to summary of the draft
    do this in core.draft.untilUserOrEnd
  make tables sortable
  add entry for fantasy draft summary to draft history dropdown?
league settings
  enable buy out button or not
  set salary cap, luxury tax, exceptions, etc
  enable/disable trading rules
cross-league play
mobile UI, bootstrap 3
  do something about hover tooltips
    injury
    skills
      for injury and skills, maybe make the whole block a hyperlink that opens a popover
        make sure to use on player page too.. can i use helpers.playerName.. there too?
    table headers
    others?
  any columns: *em css - can't i make columns use bootstrap?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
luxury tax money should be redistributed to non-taxpaying teams (or teams under the cap?)
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
better core.player.ovr formula
  regression: player = require('core/player'); player.regressRatingsPer();
    weight by minutes played
  THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WHEN PLAYER GENERATION/DEVELOPMENT OR GAMESIM CHANGES!
different owner personalities, with different priorities
trades
  "undo" button for accidental trades
    transaction log first. put "Undo" button after message from other GM only right after a trade finishes. make sure it doesn't show up at other time
      only allow undo if dbChange hasn't changed since the transaction was logged
  "When signing free agents, if you offer then a contract 2 years longer/shorter than the one they want, they'll counter offer one with 1 more/less year. If you offer the same amount of money you previously offered, and change the year to what they want, they'll automatically offer the lowest $ for that amount of years."
more detailed player moods - http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k4val/players_refusing_to_sign_bug/cbln1oo?context=3
  player personality, team chemistry
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1tkw3e/idea_player_traits/
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
some UI indicating how players developed over the offseason
  integrated into roster, or separate page?
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
player morale - punishment for tanking
team colors, and uniforms in player icons
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
more refined control of playing time
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
  somehow allow uploading of custom draft classes
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
god mode
  options
    disable ratings display
    playoff round length
  edit other player attributes (draft, etc)
profits too large, too easy
  add corporate tax?
  luxury tax increases for repeat offenders?
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  easily edit in excel?
core.freeAgents should be core.freeAgent or core.freeAgency?
after last resigning negotiation, switch to next phase?
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
test trades more
  multi-player valuation
    rank players by value. each additional value gets some multiplier to diminish its influence. this prevents adding a player to a trade from decreasing its value
    but this should have something to do with the difference between numbers of players on each side?
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
too easy to do the "be bad, get draft picks, keep payroll low, sign free agents, be good" pattern
  free agents are even less willing to sign with the user, even if it's a good team
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
database changes
  add activeYears multientry like statsTids use for:
    league leaders
    stats
    ratings
gameSim
  use real clock (this.t) rather than number of possessions
  teams should play quicker as the clock runs out
    more generally, teams should have situational awareness
  more penalty for really unbalanced rosters: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cba743c?context=3
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  do some kind of profiling, see if i can speed it up
    any way to speed up PER? maybe break it up into smaller functions so they can be profiled
    do i need all the player composite ratings?
    do i need all the team composite ratings?
    how does performance change/degrade as the years go on?
  bench players should get minutes in blowouts
in lock functions, update g from database before using any potentially sensitive values
  or should these g.whatever variables be set at all if they're sensitive? lid doesn't change obviously, but the others?
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
AI teams should periodically reorder rosters throughout the season
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
draftOrder should just be in globals, not a real table
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
If you are simulating through the whole season and execute a trade while simulating, it will continue simulating even if you are over the roster limit. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1xch01/trades_after_season/cfamo73
IE/Edge support
  compound indexes
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  https://unhosted.org/adventures/7/Adding-remote-storage-to-unhosted-web-apps.html
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
stat views
  playoff/regular season toggle in team/player stats, league leaders
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
bbgmView
  can i do some check to abandon display if idLoading is mismatched with reality? like for clicking a slow link followed by a fast link, in rapid succession, the fast output should show and the slow should be short circuited.
    in practice, this doesn't seem to matter much
  shouldn't have newPhase updateEvent doing much. instead, have an array of what changed in that phase
    (updateEvents.indexOf("newPhase") >= 0 && g.phase === g.PHASE.PRESEASON) should be newSeason
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.
git log -- js/core/gameSimNew.js
live play-by-play simulation
  slow it down http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1pu92x/new_feature_live_playbyplay_simulation/cd6xq54?context=3
  change of possession with no rebound/turnover?
  live box score
    update injury icon when player is hurt - would be easy if injury.type was observable, but it's not and I have no idea why. force update with fake name update?
    game clock using min - more accurate, but more complicated - does this even work?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  when someone wins the title, you can see the phase change at the top even while watching the live play-by-play of the last game. this leaks info about who won
